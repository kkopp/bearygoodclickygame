# A Beary Good Clicky Game :bear:

A demo of the <b>BEST BEAR GAME EVER</b> can be found [here](https://limitless-earth-55794.herokuapp.com/)!

If you have ever wanted to play a simple memory game loaded with cute bear pictures, look no further...this is the game for you!  To play the game, you click on one of the bear pictures (which shuffles the bears around).  The object of the game is to not pick the same bear image twice.  If you do, you will be jolted back to zero and will have to start the game again.  If you score 16 points, you are a memory master!
